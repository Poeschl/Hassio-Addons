# 🚨 Addons are moved 🚚

__I moved my addons to a own organisation for easier maintaining and maybe allowing contributers to maintain one addon as well. Please switch to the new repository to get future updates.__

The new home of my addons is: https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository

A migration guide is available here: [migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md](https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository/docs/migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md)
