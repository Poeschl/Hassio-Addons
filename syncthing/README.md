# Syncthing Add-on

[**Syncthing**](https://syncthing.net/) wrapped inside a [Home Assistant Supervisor add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/).

> Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.

## Available directories

When using this add-on to permanently hold your data, put the synced folders inside one of the following directories:

- `/data`
- `/media`
- `/share`
- `/config`
- `/ssl`
- `/addons`

Only the above directories are mapped into the add-on container. If you put synced folders in any other directory (like `/root` or `/mnt`), the synced data will be deleted on container restart.

Furthermore, note that

- a backup of the syncthing add-on will include the `/data` directory and its contents.
- a [*full* Home Assistant backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#backups) will include the `/media`, `/share`, `/config`, `/ssl` and `/addons` directories and their contents. Create a *partial* backup to specifically exclude any of them.
- syncing the `/backup` directory (preferably in [send only mode](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/foldertypes.html#send-only-folder)) is a simple way to automatically backup the Home Assistant backups to any of your other Syncthing devices. ðŸ˜‰
- syncing data to memory cards (eMMC, SD, etc.) might be a bad idea due to rapid wearout, or even impossible to begin with if the synced data is too large. This problem can be remedied either
  - by [configuring Home Assistant to use an external data disk](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#using-external-data-disk), or
  - by mounting a suitable storage device under one of the directories listed above (e.g. `/media/ext`) and then putting synced folders underneath that path.

    To automatically let Home Assistant OS mount USB storage devices under `/media` by their filesystem partition names, use the following udev rule:

    <details><summary><strong><code>80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules</code></strong> <sup><a href="https://gist.github.com/eklex/c5fac345de5be9d9bc420510617c86b5">Source</a></sup></summary>
  
    ```sh
    #
    # udev rule
    #   Mount USB drive to the media directory using the partition name as mount point
    #
    # Description:
    #   Created for Home Assistant OS, this rule mounts any USB drives
    #   into the Hassio media directory (/mnt/data/supervisor/media).
    #   When a USB drive is connected to the board, the rule creates one directory
    #   per partition under the media directory. The newly created partition is named
    #   as the partition name. If the partition does not have a name, then the following
    #   name format is used: "usb-{block-name}" where the block name is sd[a-z][0-9].
    #
    # Note 1:
    #   The rule name is always prefixed with a number. In this case, the rule uses 80.
    #   This represents the order of the rule when multiple rules exists in udev.
    #   Low numbers run first, high numbers run last. However, low numbers do not have all
    #   the facilities than high numbers may have.
    #   For this rule to run properly, use numbers equal or greater than 80.
    #
    # Note 2:
    #   This rule will skip mounting the 'CONFIG' USB key.
    #   https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/blob/dev/Documentation/configuration.md
    #
    # Note 3:
    #   This rule will mount the OS partitions if the OS is sorted on a USB drive (i.e. USB booting).
    #   To prevent this issue from happening, update the rule to skip the booting USB drive.
    #   See the CAUTION message below.

    # udev commands:
    #   - Restart udev to reload new rules:
    #       udevadm control --reload-rules
    #   - List device attributes of sdb1:
    #       udevadm info --attribute-walk --name=/dev/sdb1
    #   - List environment variables of sdb1:
    #       udevadm info /dev/sdb1
    #   - Trigger add/remove event for sdb1:
    #       udevadm trigger --verbose --action=add --sysname-match=sdb1
    #       udevadm trigger --verbose --action=remove --sysname-match=sdb1
    #


    # Filter on block devices, exit otherwise
    # CAUTION: Change to 'sd[b-z][0-9]' if booting from a USB drive (e.g.: sda)
    KERNEL!="sd[a-z][0-9]", GOTO="abort_rule"

    # Skip none USB devices (e.g.: internal SATA drive)
    ENV{ID_PATH}!="*-usb-*", GOTO="abort_rule"

    # Import the partition info into the environment variables
    IMPORT{program}="/usr/sbin/blkid -o udev -p %N"

    # Exit if partition is not a filesystem
    ENV{ID_FS_USAGE}!="filesystem", GOTO="abort_rule"

    # Exit if this is the 'CONFIG' USB key
    ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}=="CONFIG", GOTO="abort_rule"

    # Get the partition name if present, otherwise create one
    ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}!="", ENV{dir_name}="%E{ID_FS_LABEL}"
    ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}=="", ENV{dir_name}="usb-%k"

    # Determine the mount point
    ENV{mount_point}="/mnt/data/supervisor/media/%E{dir_name}"

    # Mount the device on 'add' action (a.k.a. plug the USB drive)
    ACTION=="add", RUN{program}+="/usr/bin/mkdir -p %E{mount_point}", RUN{program}+="/usr/bin/systemd-mount --no-block --automount=no --collect $devnode %E{mount_point}"

    # Umount the device on 'remove' action (a.k.a unplug or eject the USB drive)
    ACTION=="remove", ENV{dir_name}!="", RUN{program}+="/usr/bin/systemd-umount %E{mount_point}", RUN{program}+="/usr/bin/rmdir %E{mount_point}"

    # Exit
    LABEL="abort_rule"
    ```
    </details>
    
    The above udev rule has to be placed under `/etc/udev/rules.d/` in the Home Assistant OS *host*. This requires either [SSH access to the host](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system/debugging/#ssh-access-to-the-host) or a [`CONFIG` USB drive](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/blob/dev/Documentation/configuration.md#configuration) where you create the file `udev/80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules` with the above content. Further information and discussion can be found [on the Home Assistant community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solved-mount-usb-drive-in-hassio-to-be-used-on-the-media-folder-with-udev-customization/258406).

## Configuration

The configuration is done via the web UI. Start the add-on and configure it there.
