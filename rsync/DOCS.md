## Precondition

Make sure to have `rsync` installed on the remote machine. In case the addon gives you an `bash: rsync: command not found` in the logs `rsync` is missing there.

## Key files

The addon generates its own key files when no file is found at the specified location. If you use your own key make sure it is passwordless.

## Config

Example config:

```yaml
private_key_file: /ssl/rsync/id_rsa
username: user
folders:
  - source: /config
    destination: /home/user/config-target
  - source: /media/playlists
    destination: /home/user/cool-playlists
    options: '-archive --recursive --compress'
remote_host: ''
remote_folder: /home/user

```

### `private_key_file`
